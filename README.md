# Ininsico 
The Future of 3D Modeling — Right in Your Browser

A next-generation web-based 3D modeling platform built with the MERN stack, powered by Three.js, WebGL, and PhysicsJS — no heavy desktop software required.
 Winner — Best Website Building Project (COMSATS University Islamabad, Abbottabad Campus)

 Overview

Ininsico brings professional-grade 3D modeling directly to your browser. Think Blender, but fully online — with real-time collaboration, cloud storage, and personalized workspaces.

Whether you’re a designer, developer, or hobbyist, Ininsico lets you create, save, and share 3D models seamlessly — without installing a single piece of software.
